# PR body contract

The `pr-contract` step inside `ci-status` fails a pull request only on a
non-Conventional-Commits title or a `do-not-merge` label. The body contract is
advisory, reported by comment and the `needs-issue-linkage` label, but
expected: open with `Closes #<issue>` (or `Fixes`/`Resolves`) or
`No related issue: <reason>`, then fill `## Summary`, `## Fix`,
`## Verification`, and `## Related`. Draft from the repo's PR template (else
the `melodic-software/.github` default); canonical record:
`components/pr-convention-policy/policy.json` in `melodic-software/standards`.
