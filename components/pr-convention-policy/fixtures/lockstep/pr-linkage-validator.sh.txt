# Shared pr-issue-linkage BODY VALIDATOR. Sourced (not executed) — the single
# in-repo transcription of the melodic-software/ci-workflows pr-issue-linkage
# validator's semantics, consumed by every hook that judges a PR body against
# that check:
#   - pr-body-linkage-gate.sh   (Bash surface: `gh pr create` / `gh pr edit`)
#   - pr-linkage-mcp-gate.sh    (MCP surface: GitHub MCP create/update PR)
#   - the marketplace repo's checked-in .claude/hooks/pr-linkage-mcp-gate.sh,
#     which sources this file from its own checkout
# A drift fix against the upstream validator lands here once and reaches every
# surface atomically; per-surface extraction, scope guards, and block messages
# stay in the consuming hooks.
#
# CONTRACT — callers pin `export LC_ALL=C` BEFORE sourcing: the character
# classes below are locale-dependent and the whole point of the
# UNICODE_SPACES normalization is a locale-independent verdict. See the LOCALE
# note in either consuming hook.
#
# Function names are kept exactly as they were when these lived inline in
# pr-body-linkage-gate.sh (unprefixed), so its annotated history still reads;
# only the aggregate verdict added with the extraction is namespaced. The `_to`
# suffix each helper now carries is the one deliberate departure — see PROCESS
# BUDGET below for why the stdout form had to go.
#
# PROCESS BUDGET (#3509) — every helper here writes into a caller-named variable
# instead of onto stdout. GNU Bash forks a subshell for `$(f)` even when `f` is
# pure builtins, and forks a second for `< <(printf …)`. Measured with
# `strace -f -e trace=clone,clone3,fork,vfork,execve`, the stdout form of these
# four helpers cost `linkage::problems` 12 forks per judged body and zero extra
# `execve` — pure process-creation latency, which is the whole cost on the host
# that filed #3509 (0.3-0.9 s per spawn there, against ~3-5 ms here). `printf -v`
# and an in-shell line split cost neither a fork nor an exec. The
# `local __plv_dest="$1"` shape follows hook-utils.sh's own out-variable
# convention and stays Bash 3.2-safe (no namerefs).
#
# TRAILING-NEWLINE CONTRACT — `$(f)` strips EVERY trailing newline from what `f`
# printed, so a `_to` helper must strip them itself to stay verdict-identical to
# the stdout form it replaced. `linkage::chomp_to` is that strip, spelled once;
# `section_content_to` needs none, because trimming already removes trailing
# whitespace.
#
# DEST-NAME CONTRACT — `printf -v "$dest"` writes the helper's OWN local when
# <dest> happens to name one (bash resolves the name in the callee's scope), so
# the caller silently gets nothing back. Every caller here is `linkage::problems`
# in this same file, and its four destinations carry a `_plv_` prefix that no
# helper local uses; the differential test asserts that no `_to` helper declares
# a local matching a destination name, so a future rename cannot reintroduce the
# shadow quietly.

# Guard against double-sourcing.
